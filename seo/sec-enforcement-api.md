# SEC Enforcement Actions API

The SEC brings hundreds of enforcement actions each year against individuals and companies for securities fraud, insider trading, accounting violations, and other regulatory breaches. Datastream structures this data and exposes it through a searchable API.

## What you get

- **Structured enforcement data**: Respondent names, violation types, relief sought, penalty amounts, and dates
- **Flexible filtering**: By violation type, date range, and respondent
- **Historical coverage**: Enforcement actions from 2010 to present
- **Real-time updates**: New actions indexed within hours of SEC publication

## Quick start
